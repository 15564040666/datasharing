## Cloud computing fundamentals
- On-demand, shared and configurable pool of resources
- Rapidly provisioned
- Highly scalable

## Types of cloud computing services
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  - E.g. virtual machines with operating systems, like traditional servers
  
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
  - No need to maintain hardware or operating systems
  - E.g. Google App Engine, web applications
  
- Software as a service (SaaS)
  - E.g. ArcGIS on the cloud, Google Docs

- Data as a service
  - Collected data is shared in human readable form 
  
  ## Examples of Geospatial applications on the Cloud
  - Web frameworks with API (AralDIF/NicaDIF/HiMAT)
  - Geoserver for data sharing
