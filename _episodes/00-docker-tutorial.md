### What is Conda?
Similar to [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip), [**conda**](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) is an **open source package and environment management system** for installing multiple versions of software packages, their dependencies and switching easily between them. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows.
